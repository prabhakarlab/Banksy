This article describes the *BanksyObject* class in detail and how to interact 
with it. 

## Class structure

We use data attached with the package:

```{r rdata, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
library(Banksy)

data(hippocampus)
expr <- hippocampus$expression
locs <- hippocampus$locations
```

We store the total counts and the number of expressed genes for each cell:

```{r counts, eval=T}
total_count <- colSums(expr)
num_genes <- colSums(expr > 0)
meta <- data.frame(total_count = total_count, num_genes = num_genes)
```

The *BanksyObject* can be constructed by supplying the gene-cell expression 
matrix and cell locations. Optionally, metadata can be provided. Calling 
*BanksyObject* populates metadata and performs gene filtering in the case of 
multiple datasets. This should be the default method of construction - avoid 
setter methods for construction. 

```{r construct, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
bank <- BanksyObject(own.expr = expr, cell.locs = locs, meta.data = meta)
# Filter cells based on total count 
bank <- SubsetBanksy(bank, metadata = total_count > quantile(total_count, 0.05) &
                                      total_count < quantile(total_count, 0.98))

bank
```

The filtered dataset consists of 10,205 cells and 129 genes in 2 spatial 
dimensions.

*BanksyObject* has the following slots:

```{r slotnm, eval=T}
slotNames(bank)
```

* `own.expr` stores the gene by cell expression matrix  
* `nbr.expr` stores the averaged neighborhood expression matrix
* `harmonics` stores higher neighborhood harmonics matrices
* `custom.expr` is an auxillary slot for storing a custom expression matrix
* `cell.locs` stores the cell locations   
* `meta.data` stores cell metadata, such as cluster labels or colours for 
   visualisation  
*  `reduction` stores dimension reductions 

Getter and setter methods are defined for each of these slots.

Calling *ComputeBanksy* computes the neighbour feature-cell expression matrix,
populating the `nbr.expr` slot: 

```{r compute, eval=T}
bank <- NormalizeBanksy(bank)
bank <- ComputeBanksy(bank, verbose=FALSE)
bank <- ScaleBanksy(bank)
head(bank)
```

Dimensionality reduction with *RunBanksyPCA* or *RunBanksyUMAP* populates the `reduction`
slot:

```{r pca, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
bank <- RunBanksyPCA(bank, lambda = 0.2)

names(reduction(bank))
```

Perform clustering with *ClusterBanksy*. This populates the `meta.data` slot
with cluster labels.

```{r cluster, eval=T}
set.seed(42)
bank <- ClusterBanksy(bank, lambda = 0.2, pca = TRUE, npcs = 20,
                      method = 'leiden', resolution = 1.2, k.neighbors = 50)

head(meta.data(bank))
```

## Subsetting

*SubsetBanksy* allows users to subset a *BanksyObject* by dimension, genes, 
cells, and metadata columns. The *BanksyObject* can be subset by dimensions with
logical unquoted conditions. The variables here (e.g. `sdimx`) must correspond
to the columns names of the `cell.locs(bank)`. 

```{r subset1, eval=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
bankDim <- SubsetBanksy(bank, dims = (sdimx < -4000 | sdimx > 10000) | 
                                     (sdimy < 3000 | sdimy > 10000))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  plotSpatial(bank, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  plotSpatial(bankDim, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  ncol = 2
)
```

The object can also be subset by cells:

```{r subset2, eval=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
sample_cells <- sample(meta.data(bank)$cell_ID, 1000)
bankCells <- SubsetBanksy(bank, cells = sample_cells)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  plotSpatial(bank, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  plotSpatial(bankCells, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  ncol = 2
)
```

Similarly, the object can also be subset by any metadata column with logical 
unquoted conditions. Here, we select cells in in certain clusters based on the 
clustering with `lam=0.3`, `k=50`, `res=1.2`. 

```{r subset3, eval=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
select_clusters <- c(6,7)
bankMeta <- SubsetBanksy(bank, metadata = clust_M1_lam0.2_k50_res1.2 %in% select_clusters)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  plotSpatial(bank, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  plotSpatial(bankMeta, pt.alpha = 0.4),
  ncol = 2
)
```

Subsetting by genes can be achieved by supplying a character vector of genes
to the `features` argument:

```{r subset4, eval=T}
genes <- sample(rownames(own.expr(bank)), 10)
bankFeatures <- SubsetBanksy(bank, features = genes)
```

If multiple subsetting features are supplied, the intersection of all conditions
will be returned.
